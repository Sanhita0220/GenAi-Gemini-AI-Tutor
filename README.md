Building a Conversational Data Science Tutor with Streamlit (Intern Project at Innomatics)
I'm thrilled to share my recent internship project at Innomatics research labs! My focus was on developing a conversational AI specifically designed to address data science doubts  using the powerful Gemini 1.5 Pro model and the user-friendly Streamlit framework.

This project aimed to empower aspiring and practicing data scientists by providing them with an accessible and interactive learning companion. Users could engage in a natural conversation, asking questions about various data science concepts, tools, or techniques. The AI tutor, powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro, would then leverage its vast knowledge to deliver clear, concise, and informative responses.

Here's a glimpse of the functionalities I implemented:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): The system parsed user queries to understand their intent and extract relevant keywords related to data science.
Knowledge Base Integration: Gemini 1.5 Pro provided the foundation for the tutor's knowledge base, ensuring comprehensive and up-to-date information retrieval.
Interactive Interface: Streamlit facilitated a user-friendly interface for seamless conversation and exploration of data science concepts.
This project provided a valuable learning experience in:

Large language model (LLM) integration with practical applications.
Conversational AI design principles for a focused and effective learning experience.
Web application development using Streamlit for rapid prototyping and deployment.
